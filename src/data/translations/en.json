    "methodology": "Methodology",
    "methodologyText": "Elekti uses a comprehensive, axis-based approach to match your political views with South African political parties. Our system maps your responses across 12 distinct political dimensions and is designed to be fair, transparent, and non-partisan.",
    "howItWorks": "How It Works",
    "howItWorksText": "You answer 50 carefully crafted questions covering major policy areas including healthcare, education, economy, governance, and social issues. Each question maps to one of 12 political axes (such as Economic Left-Right, State vs Market, Labour Rights, etc.) and is weighted by importance. Your responses are converted to positions on these axes and compared with documented party positions.",
    "scoring": "Scoring System",
    "scoringText": "Our axis-based algorithm works as follows: (1) Each answer is compared to each party\u0027s position on the relevant axis, calculating similarity (1 minus the absolute difference between your position and theirs). (2) Similarities are multiplied by question weights and aggregated per axis. (3) For each party, axis scores are normalised by dividing by the total weight of questions answered on that axis. (4) A party\u0027s final score is the weighted average across all axes. Scores are displayed as percentages (0-100%), with higher scores indicating stronger alignment. We also provide a confidence rating based on your top score and the gap to alternatives.",
    "transparency": "Our Commitment to Transparency",
    "transparencyText": "All party positions and scoring weights are determined through rigorous research of official party documents. Our methodology is open and reviewable. We do not favor any political party or ideology - our sole purpose is to help you make informed decisions based on your values and the parties\u0027 stated positions.",
    "dataSources": "Our Research Sources",
    "dataSourcesText": "Party positions are meticulously researched from official party manifestos, policy documents, parliamentary voting records, and verified public statements. We update our data regularly to reflect policy changes. All source materials are from official party channels or reputable news organisations. If you believe any information is inaccurate, we welcome corrections with proper documentation.",
    "privacy": "Privacy \u0026 Your Data",
    "privacyText": "Your privacy is absolutely paramount. We believe your political views are deeply personal and deserve the highest level of protection.",
    "noTracking": "Zero Tracking",
    "noTrackingText": "We do not use cookies, analytics pixels, or any tracking technologies. We cannot see your answers, cannot identify you, and have no interest in doing so. Your quiz responses are never transmitted to our servers.",
    "localOnly": "Local Storage Only",
    "localOnlyText": "Everything happens in your browser. Your answers are stored only on your device and nowhere else. If you clear your browser data, your results are gone forever - we have no backup because we never had them in the first place.",
    "sharing": "How Sharing Works",
    "sharingText": "When you share results, your answers are encoded directly into the URL link itself. This means anyone with that link can see your results, but the data never touches our servers. You control who sees your results by controlling who gets that link. Delete the link, and your results are truly private again.",
    "analytics": "Privacy-Preserving Analytics",
    "analyticsText": "We use Cloudflare Web Analytics, a privacy-first analytics service that does not use cookies, does not track individuals across websites, and does not collect any personally identifiable information. It provides us with basic aggregated statistics (like total page views) to help us understand if the site is being used, without compromising your privacy. Cloudflare cannot see your quiz answers or identify you personally.",

    "disclaimer": "Important Disclaimer",
    "disclaimerText": "Elekti is an educational tool, not a substitute for research. Political parties are complex organisations with nuanced positions that evolve over time. We strongly encourage you to read party manifestos, attend public forums, and verify our information independently. This tool shows alignment based on stated positions - actual governance may differ. Use these results as a starting point for deeper exploration, not as your final decision.",
