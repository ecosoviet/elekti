    "methodology": "Methodology",
    "methodologyText": "Elekti uses a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to match your political views with South African political parties. Our system is designed to be fair, transparent, and non-partisan.",
    "howItWorks": "How It Works",
    "howItWorksText": "You answer 41 carefully crafted questions covering major policy areas including healthcare, education, economy, governance, and social issues. Each question is designed to reveal your political preferences without bias toward any party.",
    "scoring": "Scoring System",
    "scoringText": "Each answer you provide is matched against documented party positions from official manifestos, policy documents, and public statements. Parties receive weighted scores based on how closely their stated positions align with your responses. We use a per-party normalization algorithm, meaning each party is scored against its own best possible match for the questions you answered. This ensures fair treatment for both moderate and radical parties. These scores are normalized on a 0-100 scale, with your top match and alternatives clearly identified. We also provide a confidence rating to help you understand how strong your match is.",
    "transparency": "Our Commitment to Transparency",
    "transparencyText": "All party positions and scoring weights are determined through rigorous research of official party documents. Our methodology is open and reviewable. We do not favor any political party or ideology - our sole purpose is to help you make informed decisions based on your values and the parties' stated positions.",
