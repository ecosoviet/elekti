    "methodology": "Methodology",
    "methodologyText": "Elekti uses a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to match your political views with South African political parties. Our system is designed to be fair, transparent, and non-partisan.",
    "howItWorks": "How It Works",
    "howItWorksText": "You answer 40 carefully crafted questions covering major policy areas including healthcare, education, economy, governance, and social issues. Each question is designed to reveal your political preferences without bias toward any party.",
    "scoring": "Scoring System",
    "scoringText": "Each answer you provide is matched against documented party positions from official manifestos, policy documents, and public statements. Parties receive weighted scores based on how closely their stated positions align with your responses. We use a per-party normalization algorithm, meaning each party is scored against its own best possible match for the questions you answered. This ensures fair treatment for both moderate and radical parties. These scores are normalized on a 0-100 scale, with your top match and alternatives clearly identified. We also provide a confidence rating to help you understand how strong your match is.",
    "transparency": "Our Commitment to Transparency",
    "transparencyText": "All party positions and scoring weights are determined through rigorous research of official party documents. Our methodology is open and reviewable. We do not favor any political party or ideology - our sole purpose is to help you make informed decisions based on your values and the parties' stated positions.",
    "dataSources": "Our Research Sources",
    "dataSourcesText": "Party positions are meticulously researched from official party manifestos, policy documents, parliamentary voting records, and verified public statements. We update our data regularly to reflect policy changes. All source materials are from official party channels or reputable news organizations. If you believe any information is inaccurate, we welcome corrections with proper documentation.",
    "privacy": "Privacy & Your Data",

    "localOnly": "Local Storage Only",
    "localOnlyText": "Everything happens in your browser. Your answers are stored only on your device and nowhere else. If you clear your browser data, your results are gone forever - we have no backup because we never had them in the first place.",
    "sharing": "How Sharing Works",
    "sharingText": "When you share results, your answers are encoded directly into the URL link itself. This means anyone with that link can see your results, but the data never touches our servers. You control who sees your results by controlling who gets that link. Delete the link, and your results are truly private again.",
    "analytics": "Privacy-Preserving Analytics",
    "analyticsText": "We use Cloudflare Web Analytics, a privacy-first analytics service that does not use cookies, does not track individuals across websites, and does not collect any personally identifiable information. It provides us with basic aggregated statistics (like total page views) to help us understand if the site is being used, without compromising your privacy. Cloudflare cannot see your quiz answers or identify you personally.",
    "parties": "Parties Included",
    "partiesText": "We include 14 major South African political parties representing diverse viewpoints across the political spectrum. Our selection is based on parliamentary representation, electoral significance, and ideological diversity.",
    "disclaimer": "Important Disclaimer",
    "disclaimerText": "Elekti is an educational tool, not a substitute for research. Political parties are complex organizations with nuanced positions that evolve over time. We strongly encourage you to read party manifestos, attend public forums, and verify our information independently. This tool shows alignment based on stated positions - actual governance may differ. Use these results as a starting point for deeper exploration, not as your final decision.",
